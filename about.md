## About this blog
This blog is for me to dot down my thoughts on desktop and web development. Creating smaller applications that can automate repetetive work whether it be a plug-in for CAD/GIS programs or basic desktop applications.

This blog theme is available on Github and is designed by [The Review Index](https://thereviewindex.com).
